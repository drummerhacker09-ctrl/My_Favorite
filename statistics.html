        Lil Peep’s career lasted under three years, yet his music has accumulated billions of streams worldwide and helped define the emo rap genre. He released only one studio album during his lifetime, with several projects charting after his death. His influence continues to be felt across modern hip-hop and alternative music, making his impact far larger than his short career.
